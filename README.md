Welcome to ASAP-3DSIG

This is a site that to foster the ASAPbio vision within the 3DSIG: Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics Special Interest Group. The goal of this is
to encourage trainees and faculty to identify preprints, particuarly in BioRxiv pertinent to our field, write open peer reviews for those and publish these alongside
the preprints.
